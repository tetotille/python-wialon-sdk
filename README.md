## ✨ Characteristics

- 📡 Authentication and session management
- 📊 Real-time data access and historical reports
- 🚗 Management of units, drivers, and geofences
- 🔄 Asynchronous functions for improved performance
- 🔧 Python 3.8+ compatibility

## 🛠 Installation

You can install the SDK using pip:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tetotille/wialon-sdk.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd wialon-sdk

# Install the package
pip install .
```

### Previous requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An active account in Wialon Hosting
- Wialon API Key

## 📚 Use

Below is an example of how to start using the SDK:

```python
from wialon import Wialon

# Initialize the connection with the API key
client = Wialon(api_url="https://hst-api.wialon.com/wialon/ajax.html", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Authenticate with the API
client.auth.login("YOUR_API_KEY")

# Obtain the list of units
units = client.request("core/search_items", {"spec": {"itemsType": "avl_unit", "propName": "sys_name", "propValueMask": "*", "sortType": "sys_name"}, "force": 1, "flags": 1, "from": 0, "to": 0})
for unit in units['items']:
    print(f"Unit: {unit['nm']}, ID: {unit['id']}")

# Obtain historical data
history = client.messages.load_interval(item_id=12345, time_from=datetime(2023, 1, 1), time_to=datetime(2023, 1, 2))
print(history)
```
